        Welcom, to my Portfolio! I am a full-stack developer with Economic/Business background.
        I recently graduated from UT Austin major in Economic, minor for Business Foundation, and
        a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development that developed new skills such as Bootsrap, Javascript,
         React.js, Node.js, MySQL and more.
        Outside of software, some of my favorite hobbies include playing any types of sport, and
        reading a book. I love the outdoors as well and also love staying at home.
        I am excited to utilize my skills in the future as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team.
        Please email me with any questions and offers. I can't wait to start our project together!
